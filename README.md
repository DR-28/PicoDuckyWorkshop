# PicoPiRubberDuckyWorkshop
Workshop run by ArtemisNet for Devfest. To demo how to turn Pico Pis into Rubber Duckies.
Huge credit goes to https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky for the idea and code used in this workshop.

STEP 1)
To begin after plugin in your rubber ducky copy `adafruit-circuitpython-raspberry_pi_pico-en_US-8.2.6` into the root of your pico pi. It will then reboot.

STEP 2)
Delete everything in the Pico Pi's root folder.

STEP 3)
Download the ZIP file `PicoPiRubberDucky` and UNZIP it in the `CIRCUITPY` drive.

STEP 4)
Create a script and save it as a payload.dd and add it to the root directory of the `CIRCUITPY` drive. The payload.dd in the repository is only for mac users.
